# EFES Project - Room Temperature Controller
The project for "Electronics for Embedded Systems" course: a complete **Room Temperature Controller**.

*Please give a look at [this PDF document](https://github.com/thegabriele97/EFES_Project/blob/master/docs/efes_project_report.pdf) for a complete description of the work!*

## List of arguments covered

- Comunication protocols (UART, I implemented my own application protocol called "G-UART")
- AD/DA Conversion (a complete home-made SAR AD Converter)
- Memories (using Altera's M9K embedded memories)
- FPGAs (all the work is based on a FPGA - A lot of VHDL is written)
- Processor Peripherals ( *-This is the part I liked the most-* Thanks to my Intel's FPGA, I created a complete System On Chip based on NIOS II soft-processor Core + a complete C firmware is written + utilization of Interrupts)
- Actuator Driving (a complete DC Motor Controller with MOSFET and a lot of transistors)

Thank you!
